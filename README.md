# Darko's Tweaks Theme for BetterDiscord
***
A theme I made awhile back with a friend, now updated to work with newer versions of BetterDiscord and Discord.  
This theme auto updates (imports from this GitHub under the source folder).

# Usage
1) Add the desired theme to the themes folder for BD.
2) Reload Discord (unless auto reload is on).
3) Turn it on and enjoy!
